In Excel we are given two columns 
Column A: Number of Employees by Client 
Column B: Average Number of tickets by Client 

#**Create the Model**
C3= Slope= slope(B:B,A:A) 
C4= Intercept= intercept(B:B, A:A)
Y = (C3*X)+C4

#**Verify the Result**
C6= Correlation Coefficient = Correl(B:B, A:A) 
#closer to +-1 the stronger the correlation of the data 

Coefficient of Determination = r^2
C7 = RSQ(B:B, A:A) 
#the % of variance in observations explained by the model
#does the data fit our line
#R^2 > .9 overfit? 
#R^2 > .7 is good, most of variance is explained by model 
#R^2 < .3 is not useful
