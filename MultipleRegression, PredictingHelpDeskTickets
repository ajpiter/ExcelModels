Y = B0 _b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3... 
#Need Analsis ToolPak added in Excel

In Excel we are given 3 columns 
Column A: Average Number of tickets by Client
Column B: Number of Employees 
Column C: Value of the Contract

#**Create the Model** 
#Data Menu -- Select Data Analysis -- Hit Regression 
#input Y range should be the range of your target variable (A:A) 
#input X Range should be the range of data of predicitive variables (BC:BC) 

#**Verify the Result**
Coefficients are listed in the analysis of the data 
#closer to +-1 the stronger the correlation of the data 

Coefficient of Determination = r^2, are listed in the analysis of the data 
#used the adjusted R^2 number for multiple linear regressions 
#the % of variance in observations explained by the model
#does the data fit our line
#R^2 > .9 overfit? 
#R^2 > .7 is good, most of variance is explained by model 
#R^2 < .3 is not useful
